# Ruby code dump
Here I keep all the small things written in Ruby. Mostly for the self-reference.

## Folders
- `kata` - a collection if solutions to katas from [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/). Each file consists of my solution and one or more other solutions - either best or just interesting.
- `small` - here I put all the one-offs I come up with.
