# Read a file, convert every character of it into a pixel in a bitmap
#
# read file character after character
# if character is already in vocabulary - write to output bitmap a pixel with
# corresponding color
# else - assign a new color, write it into vocabulary, then write a pixel to a
# bitmap
#
# or maybe read a byte. Then it will be like... i don't know, interpret every
# byte as a color in rgb or something
